Tutorial
=============

Itroduction
-----------
We offer TrainT,Train,Test,Debug functions.
TrainT is a integerated way to train.

Inside process
-----------
data process flow buildin includes:
    get_raw:    get (X,y) from file
    pre:        change X to better form(mainly Tokenization).
    (grid_search: for train)
    ext:        extract feature from X.
    sel:        slect feature.
    clf:        classification. 
Refer to help for detailed and complete information.

User Learning Process 
-----------
Follow these steps to get familar with our API.
1. see templates/
2. see example/
3. see help(MakeData TrainT Train Test Debug Deploy)
    REALLY iMPORTANT!example and templats only show some!

Workflow Using
----------
1. prepare data and Makedata
2. choose a .py from templates or make yourself or using model_params, config a train file.
3. run and check.got back to [2] to update tmodel which includes userdictionary, stopwords, select.k, clf.params
[4.] use final .py and other config to train all data to get final model.set pfrac=0, cv=1.
5. now you get model(model,predict_model,nopre_model),you can use them to provide predict service.
    for example, Deploy to platform service.
